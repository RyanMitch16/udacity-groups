##The problem
It is often difficult to manage tasks like buying groceries or working on group projects with 
multiple people who all need their tasks coordinated. Keeping multiple drafts of physical lists, 
texting to keep tasks coordinated, and having to use Google docs on a mobile phone all are poor solutions.

##The solution
Groups solves this issue by providing allowing users to join groups of people that share cloud-sychronized task lists.
Lists can be shared between as many users as you need and updates happen in real time so users never have to worry about refreshing.
It's easy, fast, and specifically catered to solving task coordination problems.
